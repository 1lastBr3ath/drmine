  "description": "*Dr. Mine* is a node script written to aid automatic detection of in-browser cryptojacking. The most accurate way to detect things that happen in a browser is via browser itself. Thus, Dr. Mine uses [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) to automate browser thingy and catches any requests to online cryptominers. When a request to any online cryptominers is detected, it flags the corresponding URL and cryptominer being in use. Therefore, however the code is written or obfuscated, Dr. Mine will catch it (as long as the miners are in the list). The list of online cryptominers are fetched from [CoinBlockerLists](https://github.com/ZeroDot1/CoinBlockerLists). The result is also saved on file for later use.",
